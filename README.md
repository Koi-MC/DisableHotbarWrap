# Disable Hotbar Wrap

### What is it?
Fabric mod which stops your hotbar from wrapping around when you scroll through it. Instead, scrolling will stop at either end of the hotbar, and not go around to the other side.

### Why?
- Accessibility option which does not exist in the base game
- General Quality of Life

### Dependencies
- Fabric API
- (Optional) Mod Menu

### Install
Simply place the mod jar into your mods folder, no configurations required. Requires Fabric API.
